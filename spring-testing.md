## Spring testing

1. How do you approach testing Spring applications? Can you describe a particularly challenging test case and how you handled it?
1. Unit Testing: Explain your approach to unit testing a Spring application. What tools and frameworks do you use, and how do you ensure your tests are isolated and reliable?
1. Integration Testing: How do you approach integration testing in Spring? Describe a complex scenario where you had to ensure different components of the application worked seamlessly together.
1. Mocking Dependencies: How do you use tools like Mockito or Spring's @MockBean to mock dependencies in your tests? Provide an example where mocking was crucial for testing a specific feature.
1. Test Data Management: How do you manage test data in your Spring tests? Explain your strategy for setting up, using, and tearing down test data to ensure test reliability.
1. Transactional Tests: Describe how you use Spring's @Transactional annotation in your tests. Can you provide an example where transactional testing helped maintain data consistency during testing?
1. Spring Boot Test Utilities: Explain how you use Spring Boot's testing utilities like @SpringBootTest and @TestConfiguration. Provide an example of a scenario where these utilities significantly simplified your test setup.
1. Performance Testing: How do you approach performance testing for a Spring application? Describe a scenario where you identified and resolved performance bottlenecks through testing.
1. End-to-End Testing: Explain your strategy for end-to-end testing a Spring application. What tools do you use, and how do you ensure comprehensive test coverage?
1. Test Coverage: How do you measure and improve test coverage in your Spring applications? Describe a situation where you significantly increased test coverage and the benefits it brought.
1. Continuous Integration: How do you integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline? Provide an example of a project where continuous testing helped catch issues early and improve code quality.
1. Database Integration Tests: Your application uses multiple databases, and you need to ensure that data operations are consistent across them during testing. How do you set up your integration tests to handle this complexity? Describe a scenario where a mismatch caused issues and how you resolved it.
1. Simulating Failures: Imagine you need to test the resilience of your application under various failure conditions (e.g., network failures, database downtime). How would you simulate these failures in your tests, and what strategies would you use to ensure your application handles them gracefully?
1. Mocking External Services: Your application relies heavily on third-party services that are not always reliable. How do you mock these external services in your tests to ensure consistent and reliable test results? Describe a particularly challenging service to mock and how you tackled it.
1. Concurrency Testing: How would you test for concurrency issues in your Spring application, especially under high load conditions? Provide an example where you identified and resolved a concurrency-related bug.
1. Performance Testing with Realistic Data: Describe how you set up performance tests using realistic data sets to identify performance bottlenecks in your Spring application. What tools and techniques do you use to analyze and optimize performance?
1. End-to-End Testing in a Microservices Architecture: Your application is part of a larger microservices ecosystem. How do you approach end-to-end testing to ensure all services work together seamlessly? Describe a complex integration test scenario you’ve handled.
1. Automating Regression Tests: How do you automate regression tests to ensure new code changes don’t break existing functionality? Provide an example where your regression tests caught a critical bug before it made it to production.
1. Testing Asynchronous Code: Explain how you test asynchronous code in a Spring application. Describe a situation where testing async methods presented unique challenges and how you overcame them.
1. Security Testing: How do you test the security aspects of your Spring application, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption? Provide an example where security tests helped uncover a vulnerability.
1. Continuous Testing in CI/CD: How do you integrate continuous testing into your CI/CD pipeline? Describe a project where continuous testing significantly improved code quality and deployment reliability.
