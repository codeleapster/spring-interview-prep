## Spring Security

### Direct questions
1. Security Context Management: Explain how Spring Security manages the security context. Can you give an example of how you maintain and access the security context across different layers of the application?
2. Securing REST APIs: How do you secure RESTful APIs in a Spring application? Describe a project where API security was a major concern and how you addressed it.
3. How would you implement OAuth2 in Spring Security for securing a REST API? Can you walk me through the process?
4. Method Level Security: How do you enable and implement method-level security in a Spring application? Provide an example of a complex security rule you had to enforce.
5. JWT Tokens: Explain the process of using JWT tokens for authentication in a Spring Security application. How do you ensure the tokens are securely generated and validated?
6. OAuth2 Implementation: How would you implement OAuth2 authentication in a Spring Security application? Describe a scenario where you needed to integrate with an external OAuth2 provider.
7. LDAP Integration: Explain the process of integrating Spring Security with an LDAP server for authentication and authorization. What were the challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?

### Scenario based questions
1. Imagine you've inherited an application with outdated security measures. How would you go about implementing modern security practices using Spring Security? Give examples of how you'd manage authentication and authorization.
2. Security Vulnerabilities: Describe a situation where you discovered a security vulnerability in a Spring Boot application. How did you address it, and what practices do you follow to ensure secure coding?
3. Custom Security Filters: Describe a situation where you had to implement a custom security filter in Spring Security. What was the requirement, and how did you address it?
4. Role-based Access Control: Describe a scenario where you implemented role-based access control (RBAC) in a Spring application. How did you manage and assign roles dynamically?
5. Remember-Me Authentication: How do you implement remember-me functionality in Spring Security? What are the potential security risks, and how do you mitigate them?
6. Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF): Explain how CSRF protection is implemented in Spring Security. Describe a scenario where you had to handle exceptions to the default CSRF protection.
