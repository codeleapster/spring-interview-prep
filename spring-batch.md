## Spring Batch

1. Describe a complex batch job you implemented using Spring Batch. What were the key challenges, and how did you solve them?
1. Job Configuration: How do you configure a complex batch job in Spring Batch? Can you walk me through the various components (Job, Step, ItemReader, ItemProcessor, ItemWriter) and how they interact in a real-world scenario?
1. Chunk Oriented Processing: Explain the concept of chunk-oriented processing in Spring Batch. How would you handle a scenario where you need to process large volumes of data efficiently?
1. Job Parameters and Execution Context: Describe a situation where you had to use job parameters and execution context to manage batch job execution. How did you ensure the job could resume from where it left off in case of failure?
1. Parallel Processing: How would you implement parallel processing in a Spring Batch job to improve performance? Can you provide an example of a project where this was necessary?
1. Partitioning: Explain the partitioning technique in Spring Batch. How would you use it to handle a large dataset distributed across multiple resources?
1. Error Handling and Skip Logic: Describe how you handle errors and implement skip logic in a Spring Batch job. Can you give an example of a particularly challenging error-handling scenario you faced?
1. Job Scheduling: How do you schedule and manage Spring Batch jobs? What tools or strategies do you use to ensure jobs are executed at the correct times?
1. Spring Batch Integration: How do you integrate Spring Batch with other Spring projects (e.g., Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Data Flow)? Describe a use case where such integration was beneficial.
1. Performance Tuning: What strategies do you use to tune the performance of a Spring Batch job? Can you describe a situation where you had to optimize a batch job for better performance?
1. Real-time Batch Processing: Explain how you would approach implementing real-time batch processing with Spring Batch. What challenges might you face, and how would you address them?
1. Transactional Integrity: How would you ensure transactional integrity in a Spring Batch job that processes data across multiple systems with different transactional boundaries? Can you describe a strategy to handle this complexity?
1. Custom Listeners: Describe a scenario where you had to implement custom listeners in Spring Batch to handle specific events during job execution. What were the unique challenges, and how did you address them?
1. Resource Management: You have a batch job that processes a very large dataset, leading to memory issues. How would you manage resources efficiently to prevent memory leaks or out-of-memory errors?
1. Failure Recovery: Imagine a batch job that fails intermittently due to transient errors. How would you design the job to gracefully handle failures and ensure it can recover and restart from the point of failure?
1. Data Validation: How would you implement comprehensive data validation in a Spring Batch job to ensure data integrity before processing? Describe a complex validation scenario youâ€™ve handled.
1. Scaling Strategies: Explain your approach to scaling Spring Batch jobs horizontally across multiple nodes. What considerations do you take into account to ensure consistency and performance?
1. Exception Handling: Describe how you would handle and log exceptions in a Spring Batch job to ensure you capture sufficient diagnostic information without affecting job performance.
1. Metadata Management: How would you handle and manage batch job metadata (e.g., job execution history, statuses) in a high-throughput environment?
1. Integration with External Systems: Describe a situation where you had to integrate a Spring Batch job with an external system (e.g., a third-party API or a legacy system). What were the challenges and how did you overcome them?
1. Real-time Analytics: Suppose you need to provide real-time analytics on the data being processed by a batch job. How would you design the system to ensure data is available for analytics in near real-time?
