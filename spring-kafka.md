## Spring Kafka

### Direct Questions
1. Topic Design: How do you design Kafka topics in a Spring application to ensure efficient data distribution and fault tolerance? Provide an example where topic partitioning played a crucial role.
1. Producer Configuration: Explain how you configure a Kafka producer in Spring Kafka. Describe a scenario where you needed to fine-tune producer settings for optimal performance.
1. Consumer Groups: Discuss how you manage Kafka consumer groups in a Spring application. How do you ensure that consumers are properly load-balanced and data is processed reliably?
1. Error Handling: How do you handle errors and retries in Spring Kafka? Provide an example where you implemented a robust error handling strategy to deal with message failures.
1. Transactional Messaging: Describe how you implement transactional messaging in Spring Kafka. Explain a scenario where ensuring message delivery semantics (exactly-once or at-least-once) was critical.
1. Integration with Spring Boot: How do you integrate Spring Kafka with a Spring Boot application? Explain your approach and provide an example of a real-world use case.
1. Stream Processing: Explain how you use Kafka Streams with Spring Kafka for real-time data processing. Provide a scenario where Kafka Streams significantly improved your application's capabilities.
1. Security: How do you secure Kafka clusters in a Spring application? Discuss your approach to ensuring authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
1. Monitoring and Metrics: How do you monitor and collect metrics for Kafka in a Spring application? Describe a situation where monitoring helped you identify and resolve a performance issue.
1. Scaling and High Availability: Explain how you design a Spring Kafka application to be scalable and highly available. Provide an example where your design ensured uninterrupted service under high load.

### scenario based Questions
1. Handling High Throughput: Your application needs to process a high volume of messages with low latency. How do you optimize your Kafka producers and consumers for high throughput? Describe a situation where you achieved significant performance improvements.
1. Cross-Data Center Replication: Explain how you manage Kafka topics across multiple data centers to ensure data availability and consistency. Provide an example of a scenario where cross-data center replication was critical.
1. Exactly-Once Semantics: You need to guarantee exactly-once processing for your Kafka messages. How do you implement this in Spring Kafka, and what challenges might you face in ensuring exactly-once semantics?
1. Consumer Rebalancing: During consumer rebalancing, your application experiences downtime. How do you mitigate the impact of consumer rebalancing in a Spring Kafka application to ensure minimal disruption?
1. Error Recovery Strategies: Describe your approach to handling poison pill messages that repeatedly cause consumer failures. How do you design a robust error recovery mechanism in Spring Kafka?
1. Schema Evolution: How do you handle schema evolution for messages in Kafka to ensure backward and forward compatibility? Provide an example where managing schema changes was crucial for your application.
1. Dynamic Topic Creation: Your application needs to create and manage Kafka topics dynamically based on incoming data. How do you implement dynamic topic creation and ensure optimal configuration in Spring Kafka?
1. Message Ordering: Explain how you ensure message ordering is maintained in your Kafka application, especially when dealing with multiple partitions and consumers. Provide an example of a complex ordering requirement you handled.
1. Securing Kafka: Your application handles sensitive data and needs to comply with strict security regulations. How do you secure Kafka communication, including encryption and access control, in a Spring Kafka application?
1. Monitoring and Alerting: How do you set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for your Kafka ecosystem to detect and respond to issues proactively? Describe a scenario where monitoring helped you identify and resolve a critical problem.
