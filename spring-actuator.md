### Scenario-based questions
1. Dynamic Health Checks: Your application relies on several third-party services. How would you implement dynamic health checks in Spring Boot Actuator to ensure each service's availability is continuously monitored? Describe a scenario where these health checks helped prevent a significant outage.
1. Custom Metrics for Business Logic: Imagine you need to track custom business metrics such as user sign-ups or transactions. How do you integrate these metrics into Spring Boot Actuator and ensure they are accurately collected and reported? Provide an example of when these custom metrics were critical for business decisions.
1. Actuator in a Microservices Environment: Your microservices architecture is experiencing performance issues, but the root cause is unclear. How do you use Spring Boot Actuator to identify and resolve these issues? Describe a specific example where Actuator endpoints were instrumental in debugging and optimizing your services.
1. Securing Actuator Endpoints in Production: Your application is running in a highly regulated environment, requiring strict security measures for monitoring endpoints. How do you configure Spring Boot Actuator to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive endpoints? Provide an example of the security protocols you implemented.
1. Real-time Monitoring and Alerts: How do you set up real-time monitoring and alerting using Spring Boot Actuator endpoints in conjunction with external tools like Prometheus or Grafana? Describe a situation where real-time alerts helped you respond quickly to a critical system issue.
1. Environmental Profiling: Your application needs to behave differently based on the environment (development, staging, production). How do you use Spring Boot Actuator to expose and manage environment-specific properties and behaviors? Provide a scenario where this profiling was essential for debugging or performance tuning.
