## Spring AOP

### Direct questions

1. Explain key components of AOP.
1. What is Spring AOP?
1. What is Spring AOP Proxy pattern?
1. What is an advice? Explain its types in spring.
1. What is Spring AOP and proxy pattern?
1. Differentiate between Spring AOP and AspectJ AOP?
1. What are the advantages of AOP and its implementation?
1. Explain a situation where you had to use Aspect-Oriented Programming in Spring. What problem were you solving, and how did AOP help?
1. Describe a complex cross-cutting concern you handled with AOP. What made it particularly challenging?
1. Cross-Cutting Concerns: How do you handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or transaction management in a Spring application using AOP? Provide an example of a project where AOP significantly simplified the implementation of such concerns.
1. AspectJ Annotations: Explain how you use AspectJ annotations in Spring AOP. Can you give a detailed example of defining and applying aspects to manage application logging?
1. Performance Optimization: Describe how you would use AOP to measure and optimize the performance of your application. What specific metrics would you capture, and how would you interpret them?
1. Exception Handling: How do you use Spring AOP to handle exceptions consistently across your application? Provide an example where AOP helped you manage exception logging and recovery.
1. Method Execution: Explain how you can use AOP to control method execution. Describe a scenario where you needed to restrict certain methods from being executed under specific conditions.
1. Security: Discuss how you would implement security checks using Spring AOP. Provide an example where AOP ensured that only authorized users could access certain parts of your application.
1. Integration with Other Frameworks: How do you integrate Spring AOP with other frameworks or libraries in your application? Describe a use case where this integration was crucial for your project.
1. Testing Aspects: How do you approach testing aspects in a Spring application? Describe a particularly challenging aspect you tested and how you ensured it worked correctly in all scenarios.
1. Dynamic Proxies: Explain the difference between JDK dynamic proxies and CGLIB proxies in the context of Spring AOP. Provide an example of when you would use one over the other.
1. Weaving: How does load-time weaving differ from compile-time weaving in Spring AOP? Describe a scenario where load-time weaving was necessary for your application.


### Scenario based questions

1. Dynamic Security Checks: Your application needs to perform security checks dynamically based on the user's role and the specific resource being accessed. How would you implement this using Spring AOP? Describe the challenges you might face and how you would overcome them.
1. Monitoring and Alerting: Imagine you need to monitor and alert on specific method executions that take longer than expected. How would you use AOP to achieve this, and what strategies would you use to minimize the impact on application performance?
1. Transactional Methods: You need to ensure that certain methods are only executed within a transactional context. Describe how you would use AOP to enforce this rule and handle any exceptions that may occur.
1. Audit Logging: Suppose you need to implement audit logging for sensitive operations in your application. How would you design this using Spring AOP, ensuring that the audit logs are comprehensive and secure?
1. Third-Party API Integration: Your application integrates with a third-party API, and you need to handle retries and fallbacks gracefully. How would you use AOP to manage these cross-cutting concerns, ensuring robustness and reliability?
1. Performance Profiling: Explain how you would use AOP to create a performance profiling mechanism that can track the execution time of key methods across your application. What challenges might you encounter, and how would you address them?
1. Dynamic Aspect Activation: You need to dynamically activate or deactivate certain aspects based on runtime conditions (e.g., feature toggles). How would you implement this functionality in Spring AOP?
1. Custom Aspect Annotation: Suppose you need to create a custom annotation to apply specific aspects to certain methods. How would you design and implement this annotation and its corresponding aspect logic?
1. Integration Testing with AOP: Describe how you would test an aspect that modifies method execution in a complex integration test scenario. What strategies would you use to ensure the aspect works correctly without introducing side effects?
1. Handling Checked Exceptions: Your aspect needs to handle checked exceptions thrown by target methods and perform specific logic based on the exception type. How would you implement this in Spring AOP, ensuring that exception handling is consistent and reliable?
