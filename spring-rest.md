## Spring REST

1. How do you design and implement versioning in a RESTful API using Spring? What are the pros and cons of different versioning strategies?
1. Versioning: How do you handle versioning in REST APIs developed with Spring MVC? Describe a scenario where versioning was critical, and how you managed it. 
1. HATEOAS: Explain the concept of HATEOAS and how you implement it in a Spring REST application. Provide an example where HATEOAS significantly improved the API's usability.
1. Error Handling: How do you design and implement a consistent error handling mechanism for your RESTful APIs? Can you share a specific example of a robust error response structure?
1. Rate Limiting: How would you implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your RESTful API? Provide a scenario where this was necessary and the tools you used to enforce it.
1. Security: Describe your approach to securing RESTful APIs using Spring Security. What strategies do you use to handle authentication and authorization?
1. Testing REST APIs: How do you test RESTful APIs in Spring? Provide an example of a challenging test case and how you ensured comprehensive test coverage.
1. Content Negotiation: Explain the concept of content negotiation in Spring REST and how you handle different media types. Can you provide an example where content negotiation was essential?
1. Asynchronous Requests: Describe how you handle asynchronous requests in a Spring REST application. What benefits and challenges did you encounter?
1. API Documentation: How do you document your RESTful APIs? Explain your approach and the tools you use to ensure comprehensive and understandable API documentation.
1. Hypermedia Integration: Discuss how you integrate hypermedia into your Spring REST APIs. Provide an example of a project where hypermedia significantly improved client interactions.
1. Rate Limiting Failures: Imagine you implemented rate limiting on your RESTful API, but itâ€™s causing performance issues under high load. How would you diagnose and resolve this problem while ensuring fair usage and protection against abuse?
1. Version Migration: You need to migrate all clients from an older API version to a new one with breaking changes. How do you manage this transition smoothly without causing disruption to existing clients?
1. Circuit Breaker Implementation: Your REST API calls another third-party API that is unstable. How do you implement the circuit breaker pattern to gracefully handle failures in the third-party API and ensure your service remains responsive?
1. Complex Content Negotiation: You have a REST endpoint that needs to serve different data formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV) based on the client's request. How do you handle this content negotiation, and what challenges might arise?
1. Bulk Data Processing: Suppose you need to design a RESTful API endpoint to handle bulk data uploads efficiently. What strategies would you use to ensure the uploads are processed correctly and within acceptable performance limits?
1. Authentication in Stateless APIs: Describe a situation where you had to secure a stateless RESTful API using JWT tokens. How do you manage token expiration, refresh, and revocation to ensure secure and seamless client interactions?
1. Dynamic Filtering and Sorting: You need to implement dynamic filtering and sorting for a RESTful API endpoint, allowing clients to specify various criteria. How do you design and implement this functionality efficiently?
1. Handling Multipart Requests: Your REST API needs to handle multipart file uploads along with additional form data. How do you handle and validate these requests securely and efficiently?
1. API Gateway Challenges: In a microservices architecture, your API Gateway is causing latency issues due to complex routing and filtering rules. How do you optimize the gateway configuration to improve performance?
1. Scalability of RESTful Services: Your RESTful service experiences significant performance degradation under high traffic. How do you identify the bottlenecks and design the service to scale horizontally to handle increased load?
1. Transaction Management: Your RESTful service needs to handle a series of related operations that must all succeed or fail as a unit. How do you implement transaction management in a RESTful context to ensure consistency?
1. Throttling and Queueing: You have a REST API that handles heavy bursts of traffic, causing server overload. How would you implement throttling and queueing mechanisms to manage traffic and ensure API availability?
1. Complex Authorization Rules: Suppose you need to enforce complex authorization rules based on user roles and specific resource attributes. How do you design and implement these rules in a Spring Security context for your REST API?
1. Data Caching: You need to improve the performance of your REST API by implementing data caching. What caching strategies would you use, and how do you handle cache invalidation to ensure data consistency?
1. Rate Limiting and Monitoring: How do you implement rate limiting and real-time monitoring for your REST API to prevent abuse and track usage patterns? Describe a situation where these mechanisms helped improve API reliability.
1. API Composition: Your RESTful service needs to aggregate data from multiple microservices and present it as a single API response. How do you handle API composition efficiently and deal with potential latency issues?
1. Handling Large File Uploads: Describe how you would design a REST API to handle large file uploads, ensuring performance and security. What techniques would you use to manage file storage and retrieval?
1. Geographical Distribution: Your RESTful service needs to be deployed across multiple geographical regions to ensure low latency for global users. How do you design and deploy the service to handle this requirement?
1. Service Decomposition: You need to decompose a monolithic RESTful service into multiple microservices without affecting existing clients. How do you approach this migration, and what strategies do you use to maintain backward compatibility?
1. Dynamic Load Balancing: Explain how you would implement dynamic load balancing for your RESTful APIs in a cloud environment to ensure optimal resource utilization and high availability.
