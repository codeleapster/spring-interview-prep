1. Message Brokers: Explain your approach to integrating Spring Cloud Stream with different message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ). Provide an example where you chose one broker over another and why.
1. Stream Processing: How do you handle stream processing in Spring Cloud Stream? Describe a scenario where you needed to process and transform streams of data in real-time.
1. Error Handling and Retries: Discuss your strategy for handling errors and retries in a Spring Cloud Stream application. How do you ensure message delivery and processing reliability?
1. Dynamic Binding: Explain how you handle dynamic binding of channels and destinations in Spring Cloud Stream. Provide a real-world example where dynamic binding was essential.
1. Testing Stream Applications: Describe your approach to testing Spring Cloud Stream applications. How do you ensure comprehensive and reliable testing of stream processing components?
1. Performance Tuning: How do you optimize the performance of Spring Cloud Stream applications? Provide an example of a performance bottleneck you encountered and how you resolved it.
1. Message Serialization: Explain how you manage message serialization and deserialization in Spring Cloud Stream. What formats do you use, and how do you ensure compatibility between different services?
1. Event Sourcing: Describe how you implement event sourcing using Spring Cloud Stream. What are the benefits and challenges, and how do you address them?
1. Monitoring and Metrics: How do you monitor and collect metrics for Spring Cloud Stream applications? Provide an example where monitoring helped you identify and resolve a critical issue.

### Scenario based questions
1. Dynamic Partition Management: Your application needs to dynamically adjust the number of partitions for a Kafka topic based on load. How do you implement dynamic partition management in Spring Cloud Stream to handle varying data loads efficiently?
1. Backpressure Handling: Describe a scenario where your Spring Cloud Stream application experienced backpressure due to high message throughput. How did you detect and mitigate backpressure to maintain system stability?
1. Multi-broker Integration: Suppose you need to integrate Spring Cloud Stream with multiple message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) within the same application. How do you design and configure your application to handle messages from different brokers seamlessly?
1. Dead-letter Queue Handling: Your application requires robust error handling with a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for failed messages. Explain how you configure and manage DLQs in Spring Cloud Stream, and provide an example of when this was critical.
1. Real-time Data Transformation: You need to perform complex data transformations on-the-fly as messages flow through your Spring Cloud Stream application. How do you design and implement this in a way that ensures high performance and low latency?
1. Event-driven Microservices: Describe how you would implement a complex event-driven microservices architecture using Spring Cloud Stream, where multiple services need to react to events from various sources. What challenges might you face, and how do you address them?
1. Schema Evolution: Your application requires handling evolving data schemas in messages to ensure backward and forward compatibility. How do you manage schema evolution in Spring Cloud Stream, and what tools do you use?
1. Multi-tenant Architecture: Explain how you design a Spring Cloud Stream application to support multi-tenancy, ensuring each tenantâ€™s data is isolated and processed independently. Provide an example scenario where this was necessary.
1. Stream Processing Pipelines: You need to build a complex stream processing pipeline that involves multiple transformations, filtering, and aggregations. How do you orchestrate this pipeline using Spring Cloud Stream, and ensure efficient processing?
1. Monitoring and Alerting: Describe how you set up monitoring and alerting for your Spring Cloud Stream application to detect anomalies and performance issues in real-time. Provide an example where proactive monitoring helped prevent a critical failure.
