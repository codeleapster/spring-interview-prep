## Spring Cloud Config

### Direct questions

1. Configuration Management: Explain how you manage configuration across multiple environments using Spring Cloud Config. Can you provide an example of a scenario where centralized configuration management was crucial?
1. Configuration Drift: Describe a scenario where configuration drift caused issues in your microservices. How did you use Spring Cloud Config to detect and resolve these inconsistencies?
1. Centralized Configuration: How do you set up centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config? Describe a scenario where centralized configuration was essential for managing configurations across multiple environments.
1. Encryption and Security: Explain how you handle sensitive data in Spring Cloud Config. How do you encrypt configuration properties and ensure secure access to the configuration server?
1. Dynamic Configuration Refresh: How do you enable and handle dynamic configuration refresh in a Spring Cloud Config application? Provide an example where dynamic refresh was crucial for updating configurations without downtime.
1. Config Server High Availability: Describe how you set up a highly available and fault-tolerant Spring Cloud Config Server. What strategies do you use to ensure the config server remains available during network partitions or server failures?
1. Git Integration: Explain how you integrate Spring Cloud Config with a Git repository for managing configurations. Describe a project where version-controlled configuration management was beneficial.
1. Handling Large Configuration Files: How do you manage and organize large configuration files in Spring Cloud Config to ensure maintainability and readability?
1. Multi-environment Support: How do you handle configurations for multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) in Spring Cloud Config? Provide an example of a complex environment-specific configuration setup.
1. Configuring Clients: How do you configure Spring Boot applications to consume configurations from Spring Cloud Config Server? Describe a challenging scenario where client configuration was critical.
1. Monitoring Configuration Changes: How do you monitor and track configuration changes in Spring Cloud Config? Provide an example where tracking changes helped you identify and resolve a configuration-related issue.
1. Integration with Other Spring Projects: Explain how you integrate Spring Cloud Config with other Spring Cloud projects (e.g., Eureka, Zuul). Provide an example where this integration improved your application's configuration management.
 
### Scenario based questions
 
1. Dynamic Configuration Updates: Your application needs to dynamically update its configuration without restarting. How do you implement this with Spring Cloud Config, and what challenges might you face in ensuring the application can adapt to these changes seamlessly?
1. Handling Config Server Failures: Suppose your Spring Cloud Config Server goes down or becomes unavailable. How do you design your application to handle this failure gracefully and maintain service continuity?
1. Security of Sensitive Data: You need to store and manage sensitive configuration data such as passwords and API keys. How do you encrypt these configurations in Spring Cloud Config, and how do you ensure they are securely accessed by client applications?
1. Versioned Configuration Rollback: Imagine a scenario where a recent configuration change causes issues in production. How do you roll back to a previous version using Spring Cloud Config, and what steps do you take to minimize disruption?
1. Scaling Config Server: Your application environment has grown, and you now have multiple microservices that rely on Spring Cloud Config. How do you scale the Config Server to handle the increased load and ensure high availability?
1. Multi-tenant Configuration Management: You are developing a multi-tenant application, and each tenant requires different configurations. How do you manage tenant-specific configurations in Spring Cloud Config while ensuring security and isolation?
1. Environment-specific Configurations: Describe how you handle configurations that vary significantly across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). How do you ensure that environment-specific properties are managed effectively in Spring Cloud Config?
1. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines: Explain how you integrate Spring Cloud Config with your CI/CD pipeline to automate configuration updates. What challenges might you encounter, and how do you ensure that configurations are correctly applied during deployments?
1. Audit and Change Tracking: How do you implement audit and change tracking for configuration changes in Spring Cloud Config? Describe a situation where this was crucial for debugging or compliance purposes.
1. Fallback Configuration Strategies: In case the Spring Cloud Config Server is temporarily unavailable, how do you implement fallback strategies to ensure your application can continue to function with default or cached configurations?
